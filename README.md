### Project Overview

This data analysis project is intended to conduct a market analysis **in Python** to assist a fitness studio based in Philippines with:

### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the *"nobel_dataset.csv"* file, containing detailed information about each award winner up to date ever since the Prize was established.


### Tools

- [Anaconda Navigator: ](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
  - To access the Jupyter Notebook for **Python**


### Data Preparation

Only *the nobel_dataset.csv* dataset was first inspected and then imported into a Pandas DataFrame to begin conducting the exploratory data analysis work:


### Exploratory Data Analysis

Depending upon Google Trends and also YouTube keyword searches in niche instances, EDA aimed at answering some key questions, such as:

1.  How does the trend of global demand for workout appear for the timeframe between mid-March 2018 and mid-March 2023?
  - During this period, in which month-year was this demand highest on average?

2.  Which of these three keywords - *gym workout*, *home workout* and *home gym*, generated most interest in 2020 and also during 2022-2023 separately? 
3.  What are the top 20 countries with the highest interest in workout, which hinges on this keyword search?
4.  What is the breakdown of the three workout keywords for certain Middle Eastern and South Asian countries (aka. MESA), including Philippines and Singapore?
5.  Based on YouTube keyword searches, which workout type (e.g., yoga, weight lifting) generated highest interest in Philippines during the timeframe at hand?


### Data Analysis

```python

```

### Findings

The critical analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. Interest in workouts tends to be rather seasonal, spiking at the beginning of each year due to presumably people's part of New Year resolutions.
  - However, there is an anomaly observed in year 2020, with another but more powerful spike in global interest in workouts, shortly following the COVID announcement - in **April 2020**
